        <h1>Retired</h1>
        <p class="normal"> Like many civil servants, I was able to  retire at 60.
        With the  whole world  in front of me, I thought that I  would make up a
        bucket  list.</p>
        <h2>Bucket List</h2>
        <ol >
          <li>Continue to be a good life partner</li>
          <li>Learn Python</li>
          <li>Attain spiritual enlightenment</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Two Streams of Retired Life</h2>
        <p class="normal">These days people may retire in their 50s or early 60s
          but will stay active to some degree to make extra money and explore their
          interests.</p>
